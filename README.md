Description of Group Project â€“ High	Fidelity Prototype
Develop a high fidelity prototype for your applications based on the preliminary design. For the assignment, the prototype must be a runnable program and should provide a wide range of functions as you have proposed although each function might still have little detail (i.e., horizontal compromise).

You will still have up to another week to improve your high-fidelity prototype before the prototype	undergoes usabliity testing.
No online submission is required for this assignment. However, each group must present a 10-minute live demo of the	high-fidelity prototype on Monday & Wednesday class	meeting, 14 & 16 November 2016.
